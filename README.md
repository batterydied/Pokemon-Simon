# PokeSimon

## Description

This game is inspired by the classic **Simon** game, a memory skill game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds. 
The game consists of a series of colored buttons that light up in a specific order, and the player must replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons or pressing the corresponding keyboard keys.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Click anywhere to begin the game. A random pattern will be generated.
2. **Follow the Sequence**: The game will light up the buttons in a specific order. Listen to the sounds and watch the lights.
3. **Repeat the Pattern**: After the sequence is played, it's your turn to repeat the pattern. You can either click the buttons with your mouse or use the corresponding keyboard keys.
4. **Continue Playing**: If you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add another light to the pattern. Continue until you make a mistake!
5. **Game Over**: If you fail to replicate the sequence correctly, the game ends. You can restart the game to try again.
